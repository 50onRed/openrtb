Google OpenRTB Libraries
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This library supports the OpenRTB specification, providing
bindings for all protobuf-supported languages, and additional
support for Java such as JSON serialization and validation.

See our [wiki](https://github.com/google/openrtb/wiki) to get started!
Use the Github issue tracker for bugs, RFEs for any support.


BUILDING NOTES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You need: JDK 7, Maven 3.2, Protocol buffers (protoc) 2.6.0.
Building is supported from the command line with Maven and
from any IDE that can load Maven projects.

On Eclipse, the latest m2e is recommended but it can't run the code
generation step, so you need to run a "mvn install" from the command
line after checkout or after any mvn clean. Building with JDK 8 will
also not work, because we use the error-prone lint tool which is not
yet compatible with JDK 8 (once built, the library works with JDK 8).


RELEASE NOTES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Version 0.7.3, 02-12-2014

* Partial support for OpenRTB 2.3! The missing item is Native ads,
  which depends on the OpenRTB Native 1.0 spec (proposed final draft
  at this time). This support will come in a future update.
* Breaking change: The Flags enum was replaced by simple booleans.
* Breaking change: Renamed DirectDeal to just Deal (to better match
  the spec, although object names are not really standardized).
* New fields added (OpenRTB 2.3):
  - BidRequest: test
  - Site: mobile
  - Device: w, h, pxratio, ppi, hwv, lmt
  - Bid: cat, bundle
  - Geo: utcoffset
* Othe fields added (missing from OpenRTB 2.2):
  - Device: ifa, macsha1, macmd5
  - Impression: secure
  - Video: protocols (the field protocol was deprecated; in the API
    it's renamed deprecated_protocol, JSON will be compatible)
  - BidResponse: nbr
