/**
 * Sample JSON writer for a repeated extension of message type.
 * <p>
 * To support repeated extensions, the super-call needs the field name and object/scalar option.
 * The field name, the array-open and array-close tokens, and (for objects) the object-open
 * and object-close tokens, will all be emitted by the framework, so the {@link #write()} method
 * provided here is the same you need for a regular extension: just write all fields for one item.
 * Suppose {@code x: ( ext: ( a: 10 ))} and {@code y: ( ext: ( b: [ ( a: 1 ), ( a: 2 ) ] ))}.
 * where {@code x.ext.a} is a regular extension and {@code y.ext.b} is a repeated extension
 * which value is a sequence of the same {@code x.ext.a} objects, you can share the writer.
